This is a rock-paper-scissors game for the odin project. It uses prompt for input, and alert for output. It is currently clunky, but once I learn DOM manipulation, I'll update this project.

Here are the things which I learned from this project:
1. Breaking the code into pieces, and writing those pieces in functions.
2. Implementing the random generation for the game.
3. Keeping the code readable.
