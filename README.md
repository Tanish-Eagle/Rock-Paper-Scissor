This is a rock-paper-scissors game for the odin project. It uses prompt for input, and alert for output. It is currently clunky, but once I learn DOM manipulation, I'll update this project.

Here are the things which I learned from this project:
1. Breaking the code into pieces, and writing those pieces in functions.
2. Implementing the random generation for the game.
3. Keeping the code readable.

Update August 17, 2023:

Simplified the user interface. Added 3 buttons for the 3 choices, and the results are delivered to the page dynamically. The game does not count draws any more, and the message clearly tells that the game will last for five rounds (draws not counting), which was not the case before.
